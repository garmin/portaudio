Notes on status of CoreAudio Implementation of PortAudio

Document Last Updated December 9, 2005

There are currently two implementations of PortAudio for Mac Core Audio.

The original is in pa_mac_core_old.c, and the newer one is in pa_mac_core_auhal.c.
Only pa_mac_core_auhal.c is currently developed and supported as it uses apple's
current core audio technology. To select one of the implementations, copy the
appropriate file to pa_mac_core.c, (eg. "cp pa_mac_core_auhal.c pa_mac_core.c")
then run configure and make as usual.

WHAT WORKS

Output with very low latency, <10 msec.
Half duplex input or output.
Full duplex on the same CoreAudio device.
The paFLoat32, paInt16, paInt8, paUInt8 sample formats.
Pa_GetCPULoad()
Pa_StreamTime()

KNOWN BUGS OR LIMITATIONS

We do not yet support simultaneous input and output on different 
devices. Note that some CoreAudio devices like the Roland UH30 look 
like one device but are actually two different CoreAudio devices. The 
Built-In audio is typically one CoreAudio device.

Mono doesn't work.

DEVICE MAPPING

CoreAudio devices can support both input and output. But the sample 
rates supported may be different. So we have map one or two PortAudio 
device to each CoreAudio device depending on whether it supports 
input, output or both.

When we query devices, we first get a list of CoreAudio devices. Then 
we scan the list and add a PortAudio device for each CoreAudio device 
that supports input. Then we make a scan for output devices.

Notes on Newer AUHAL implementation:

Principle of Operation:

This implementation uses AUHAL for audio I/O. To some extent, it also
operates at the "HAL" Layer, though this behavior can be limited by
platform specific flags (see pa_mac_core.h for details). The default
settings should be reasonable: they don't change the SR of the device and
don't cause interruptions if other devices are using the device.

Major Software Elements Used: Apple's HAL AUs provide output SR
conversion transparently, however, only on output, so this
implementation uses AudioConverters to convert the sample rate on input.
A PortAudio ring buffer is used to buffer input when sample rate
conversion is required or when separate audio units are used for duplex
IO. Finally, a PortAudio buffer processor is used to convert formats and
provide additional buffers if needed. Internally, interleaved floating
point data streams are used exclusively - the audio unit converts from
the audio hardware's native format to interleaved float PCM and
PortAudio's Buffer processor is used for conversion to user formats.

Simplex Input: Simplex input uses a single callback. If sample rate
conversion is required, a ring buffer and AudioConverter are used as
well.

Simplex output: Simplex output uses a single callback. No ring buffer or
audio converter is used because AUHAL does its own output SR conversion.

Duplex, one device (no SR conversion): When one device is used, a single
callback is used. This achieves very low latency.

Duplex, separate devices or SR conversion: When SR conversion is
required, data must be buffered before it is converted and data is not
always available at the same times on input and output, so SR conversion
requires the same treatment as separate devices. The input callback
reads data and puts it in the ring buffer. The output callback reads the
data off the ring buffer, into an audio converter and finally to the
buffer processor.



Known issues:

- Latency: Latency settings are ignored except when doing I/O between different
devices. Still, latency should be very low.

- Timing info. It reports on stream time, but I'm probably doing something
wrong since patest_sine_time often reports negative latency numbers.

- xrun detection: The only xrun detection performed is when reading
and writing the ring buffer. There is probably more that can be done.

- abort/stop issues: stopping a stream is always a complete operation,
but latency should be low enough to make the lack of a separate abort
unnecessary. Apple clarifies its AudioOutputUnitStop() call here:
http://lists.apple.com/archives/coreaudio-api/2005/Dec/msg00055.html

- blocking interface: Not implemented.

- multichannel: I don't have a multichannel IO box, so I didn't test it.
It should work though ;) I haven't done anything with "channel maps"
yet, so it's possible that more needs to be done.

- sample rate conversion quality: the input audio converter is set to
the highest quality. I don't do anything about the output converter, and
I am not sure how AUHAL manages quality.

- x86: I haven't tested it on an x86 Mac, but I tried to be aware of it, so
it should work without too much trouble.
