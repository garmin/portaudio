            PaStream** stream
                - is non-null

            - at least one of inputDevice & outputDevice is valid (not paNoDevice)

                the same host api

            PaDeviceIndex inputDevice
                - is within range (0 to Pa_CountDevices-1)

            int numInputChannels
                - if inputDevice is valid, numInputChannels is > 0
                - upper bound is NOT validated against device capabilities
                - will be zero if inputDevice is paNoDevice

            PaSampleFormat inputSampleFormat
                - is one of the sample formats defined in portaudio.h

            void *inputStreamInfo

                - sampleRate is NOT validated against device capabilities

            PaStreamFlags streamFlags
                - unused platform neutral flags are zero


        The following validations MUST be performed by (*OpenStream)():

            - check that input device can support numInputChannels
            
            - check that input device can support inputSampleFormat, or that
                we have the capability to convert from outputSampleFormat to
                a native format

            - if inputStreamInfo is supplied, validate its contents,
                or return an error if no inputStreamInfo is expected

            - check that output device can support numOutputChannels
            
            - check that output device can support outputSampleFormat, or that
                we have the capability to convert from outputSampleFormat to
                a native format

            - if outputStreamInfo is supplied, validate its contents,
                or return an error if no outputStreamInfo is expected

            - if a full duplex stream is requested, check that the combination
                of input and output parameters is supported

            - check that the device supports sampleRate

            - alter sampleRate to a close allowable rate if necessary

            - validate inputLatency and outputLatency

            - validate any platform specific flags, if flags are supplied they
                must be valid.
