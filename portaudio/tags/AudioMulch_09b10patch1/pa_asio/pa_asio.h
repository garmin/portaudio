PaError PaAsio_GetAvailableLatencyValues( PaDeviceIndex device,

/**<
 Retrieve legal latency settings for the specificed device, in samples.

 @param device The global index of the device about which the query is being made.
 @param minLatency A pointer to the location which will recieve the minimum latency value.
 @param maxLatency A pointer to the location which will recieve the maximum latency value.
 @param minLatency A pointer to the location which will recieve the preferred latency value.
 @param granularity A pointer to the location which will recieve the granularity. This value 
 determines which values between minLatency and maxLatency are available. ie the step size,
 if granularity is -1 then available latency settings are powers of two.

 @see ASIOGetBufferSize in the ASIO SDK.

 @note This function should have a better name, any suggestions?
