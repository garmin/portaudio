/*
    IMPORTANT:

    WASAPI is implemented for Callback and Blocking interfaces. It supports Shared and Exclusive
    share modes. 
    
    Exclusive Mode:

        Exclusive mode allows to deliver audio data directly to hardware bypassing
        software mixing.
        Exclusive mode is specified by 'paWinWasapiExclusive' flag.

    Callback Interface:

        Provides best audio quality with low latency. Callback interface is implemented in 
        two versions:

        1) Event-Driven:
        This is the most powerful WASAPI implementation which is capable to provides glitch-free
        audio at 2ms latency in Exclusive mode. Lowest possible latency for this mode is 
        usually - 2ms for HD Audio class audio chips (including on-board audio, 2ms was achieved 
        on Realtek ALC888/S/T). For Shared mode latency can not go lower than 20ms.

        2) Poll-Driven:
        Polling is another 2-nd method to operate with WASAPI. It is less efficient than Event-Driven
        and provides latency at around 12-13ms. Polling must be used to overcome a system bug
        under Windows Vista x64 when application is WOW64(32-bit) and Event-Driven method simply times
        out (event handle is never signalled on buffer completion). Please note, such Vista bug 
        does not exist in Windows 7 x64.
        Polling is setup by speciying 'paWinWasapiPolling' flag.
        Thread priority can be boosted by specifying 'paWinWasapiBlockingThreadPriorityPro' flag.

    Blocking Interface:

        Blocking interface is implemented but due to above described Poll-Driven method can not
        deliver low latency audio. Specifying too low latency in Shared mode will result in 
        distorted audio although Exclusive mode adds stability.

    Pa_IsFormatSupported:

        To check format with correct Share Mode (Exclusive/Shared) you must supply
        PaWasapiStreamInfo with flags paWinWasapiExclusive set through member of 
        PaStreamParameters::hostApiSpecificStreamInfo structure.

    Pa_OpenStream:

        To set desired Share Mode (Exclusive/Shared) you must supply
        PaWasapiStreamInfo with flags paWinWasapiExclusive set through member of 
        PaStreamParameters::hostApiSpecificStreamInfo structure.
